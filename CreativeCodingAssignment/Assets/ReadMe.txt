Overview: This is a world spawner that creates forests, towns, crystal mining sites, and incidental trees over a fixed terrain. It is supposed to evoke a mild fantasy aesthetic. 

Controls: WASD and Mouse. Sensitivity is weird because of performance (probably a framerate thing oops).

If testing the spawner systems, you can just right click on the script on the 'SCENESPAWNER' object and select "Spawn World" (this will clear the scene as well)
The category specific spawners work pretty much the same. You can turn off the fog in windows > rendering > lighting > scroll to the bottom and uncheck fog.
(Only noticed the weird voice snipped in one of the ambient sounds right before submission. Uhhhhhh just ignore that)
